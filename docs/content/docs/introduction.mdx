# Introduction to zen-omni

## What is zen-omni?

zen-omni is a multimodal AI model based on Qwen3-Omni architecture that can understand and process text, images, and audio simultaneously. It's part of the Zen LM family of models focused on democratizing AI while protecting our planet.

## Why zen-omni?

### Multimodal Understanding

Unlike text-only models, zen-omni natively supports:
- **Text** - Natural language understanding and generation
- **Vision** - Image analysis and visual reasoning
- **Audio** - Speech recognition and audio understanding

### Based on Qwen3-Omni

zen-omni is built on Qwen3-Omni, a groundbreaking unified multimodal architecture that:
- Processes multiple modalities simultaneously
- Enables cross-modal reasoning
- Provides state-of-the-art performance

### Privacy-First Design

- **100% local processing** - No cloud required
- **No telemetry** - Your data stays on your device
- **Open source** - Apache 2.0 licensed
- **Free forever** - No premium tiers or API fees

### Environmentally Responsible

- 95% less energy than cloud AI
- Optimized for efficient inference
- Carbon-negative operations through Zoo Labs Foundation

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Text Generation** - High-quality natural language
- 🖼️ **Image Understanding** - Visual question answering
- 🎙️ **Voice Interaction** - Speech-to-speech capabilities
- 💬 **Multimodal Chat** - Process mixed inputs seamlessly
- 🌍 **Multilingual** - Strong performance across languages

## Get Started

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoProcessor

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("zenlm/zen-omni")
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("zenlm/zen-omni")

# Process multimodal inputs
inputs = processor(
    text="What's in this image?",
    images=image,
    return_tensors="pt"
)

outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
```
